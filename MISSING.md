**Progress: 118 fixed / 197 total — 79 remaining**

---

## 1. EXCHANGE FLOW

- [x] `rejectExchange()` Server Action does not exist — fixed: added in d4a72e7
- [x] `acceptExchange()` never touches the books collection — fixed: books go `reserved` in a transaction (28fb49b, d4a72e7)
- [x] No `reserved` or `on_hold` status type in `types.ts` BookStatus union — fixed: `on_hold` added d4a72e7; `reserved` was already present
- [x] `cancelExchange()` sets status to `cancelled` but never restores book statuses — fixed: books restored to `active` in d4a72e7
- [x] `confirmExchangeCompletion()` sends no email to either party on completion — fixed: emails sent to both parties on bothConfirmed
- [x] `proposeExchange()` never calls `createExchangeProposalNotification()` — fixed: d4a72e7
- [x] `acceptExchange()` never calls `createExchangeUpdateNotification()` — fixed: d4a72e7
- [x] `confirmExchangeCompletion()` creates no notification for either party — fixed: d4a72e7
- [x] `cancelExchange()` creates no notification — fixed: d4a72e7
- [x] No timeout or auto-expiry for stale in-progress exchanges — fixed: cleanup-jobs.ts cancelStaleExchanges
- [x] Exchange completion never auto-updates book status to `exchanged` — fixed: transaction in confirmExchangeCompletion handles this (5392b2f)
- [x] `canUserReview()` only checks for a duplicate review — fixed: requires completed exchange between users (0c534d6)
- [x] Socket: client hook emits `joinExchange`/`leaveExchange` but `server.ts` has no handlers — fixed: handlers exist at server.ts:288 (was false positive)

---

## 2. DONATION FLOW

- [x] `orgConfirmed` field never set to `true` — fixed: `confirmDonationOffer` action added (d0f4611)
- [x] `confirmDonationReceipt()` never updates Book documents — fixed: books set to `donated` (d0f4611)
- [x] `initiateDonation` non-atomic — fixed: core writes wrapped in MongoDB transaction (d0f4611)
- [ ] `DonationBook.bookId` is optional and typically unpopulated — no reliable link back to Book documents
- [x] `updateDonationBooks()` no existence or ownership validation — fixed: validates each book (d0f4611)
- [x] No donation history page — fixed: `/donate/history` added in 0c534d6
- [x] No public organization profile page — fixed: `/organizations/[id]` added (cd4883c)

---

## 3. AUTHENTICATION & ONBOARDING

- [x] Email verification unimplemented — fixed: token collection, verify-email page, signUpUser sends link (f6b2719)
- [x] `deactivateUser()` does not exist — fixed: cancels exchanges, restores books, sets deactivatedAt (f6b2719)
- [ ] No account recovery flow for deactivated accounts
- [x] `suspendUser()` stores no timestamps — fixed: suspendedAt + suspensionReason added (8d62a17)
- [ ] No email change verification
- [x] `signUpUser()` no DB unique index on email — fixed: sparse unique index added (f6b2719)
- [ ] Profile completion modal can be permanently dismissed via localStorage — incomplete profile is not blocked

---

## 4. BOOK LISTING & DISCOVERY

- [x] `listBook()` has zero content moderation calls — fixed: ContentModerationSystem.analyzeContent called before insert
- [x] `deleteBook()` uses hard `deleteOne()` — fixed: soft delete with `deletedAt` (0c534d6)
- [ ] `intelligentBookSearch` and `generateBookSummary` AI flows implemented but never called from any UI
- [ ] `getBooksForSale()` uses `$regex` search; `getBooksForExchange()` uses MongoDB `$text` index — inconsistent strategy
- [x] `getBooksForSale()` no pagination — fixed: page/limit added, returns paginated envelope (8d62a17)
- [ ] No "My Books" management page for sellers — no Edit/Delete buttons on book detail page
- [x] No global `/search` results page — fixed: `/search` page added in 0c534d6
- [x] No exchange detail standalone page (`/exchange/[id]`) — fixed: added in cd4883c

---

## 5. MESSAGING

- [x] `startChat()` race condition — fixed: atomic findOneAndUpdate upsert (3f9bd00)
- [x] Socket `sendMessage` writes message to DB first, then emits — already guarded: emit is inside `if (modifiedCount > 0)` block (false positive)
- [ ] Unread count calculated two different ways in legacy vs new chat route handlers — no single source of truth
- [x] Blocking is one-directional — only blocker's `blockedUsers` array updated — fixed: blockUser/unblockUser now update both parties
- [x] `messagesRead` never emitted by `server.ts` — fixed: f4c6a89
- [x] `newChatCreated` never emitted by `server.ts` — fixed: f4c6a89
- [x] Two competing Socket.IO implementations — fixed: socket-server.ts updated to use `user_${id}` to match server.ts

**Partially fixed (5fce5ca):**
- [x] `sendMessage` trusts client-provided `senderId` — fixed: uses `socket.userId`
- [x] `joinUserRoom` accepts any userId — fixed: verified against `socket.userId`
- [x] `joinChat` allows unauthenticated sockets — fixed: hard auth gate + participant check

---

## 6. COMMUNITY

- [x] `toggleCommunityMembership()` allows direct join regardless of `visibility: 'private'` — fixed: 0c534d6

---

## 7. REVIEWS & RATINGS

- [x] Review received creates no in-app notification for the reviewee — fixed: 0c534d6

---

## 8. NOTIFICATIONS

- [x] Exchange proposal: `createExchangeProposalNotification()` never called by `proposeExchange()` — fixed: d4a72e7

- [x] Admin moderated your content: no notification created — fixed: 0c534d6
- [ ] Community @mention: no @mention detection exists anywhere in the codebase

- [ ] Weekly digest preference field exists in User type but no job ever sends it

---

## 9. ADMIN PANEL

- [ ] No book/listing management section — cannot view, search, remove, or feature any listing from admin
- [ ] No exchange/transaction oversight section — cannot view exchanges or intervene in disputes
- [ ] Audit log viewer missing — activity logs are written to DB but no admin UI reads them
- [x] Report management UI missing — fixed: reports tab added to admin dashboard with status filter and resolve/remove actions
- [ ] System settings are view-only — all "Configure" buttons have no `onClick` handlers
- [ ] No announcement/broadcast system

- [ ] No dispute resolution tools
- [ ] No organization activity view or suspension capability

- [x] `suspendUser()` and `removeContentAndResolveReport()` write no activity log entries — fixed: suspendUser now inserts to auditLogs
- [ ] Admin search API (`/api/admin/search`) exists but is not referenced by any admin UI tab

---

## 10. SOCKET.IO / REAL-TIME

- [ ] Socket.IO Redis adapter never initialized in `server.ts` — multi-server deployment: room broadcasts do not cross instances
- [ ] JWT verified only once at `authenticate` event — expired tokens accepted for the full session lifetime
- [x] `joinUserRoom` (server.ts:99) accepts client-provided `userId` with zero JWT verification — fixed: 5fce5ca

---

## 11. SECURITY & VALIDATION

- [ ] Only ~30 of 104 exported Server Actions have any Zod parsing
- [x] `submitReport` — fixed: Zod schema wired (schema existed, now validated)

- [ ] `applyForOrganization` — uses custom validator instead of Zod schema
- [x] No `src/middleware.ts` — fixed: added NextAuth route protection in 0c534d6
- [x] `resetPassword` has no rate limit — fixed: 0c534d6
- [x] 4 critical actions missing rate limits — fixed: submitReport, submitReview, startChat, blockUser (ac3bfa8)
- [ ] Auth rate limiting uses in-memory `Map` — resets on server restart, bypassed under load balancing

- [ ] CSP header uses `'unsafe-eval'` + `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src`
- [x] Hardcoded `'dev-media-secret'` fallback in upload-token route — fixed: always requires MEDIA_API_SECRET env var

### Fixed summary by commit:
- **5392b2f** — exchange/donation core fixes (book status on completion, donation flow)
- **28fb49b** — 6 review findings (atomic book reservation, race conditions)
- **0c534d6** — parallel batch: 8 indexes, 2 pages, notifications, soft delete, middleware, infra
- **d4a72e7** — exchange state machines: on_hold/reserved, rejectExchange, all exchange notifications
- **d0f4611** — donation flow: book status on completion, org confirm action, atomic inserts, book validation
- **cd4883c** — new pages: /exchange/[id] detail + /organizations/[id] profile

### Removed from original list (verified as already implemented):
- ~~No mark all as read~~ — exists in `notification-provider.tsx:96`
- ~~No DB unique constraint on reviews~~ — exists in `database-maintenance.ts:141`
- ~~Price not required for type=sale~~ — validated in `schemas.ts:69`
- ~~All 4 AI flows not wired to UI~~ — `analyzeBookCondition` wired to sell page, `getBookRecommendations` wired to floating assistant
- ~~No server-side HTML sanitization~~ — `sanitizeInput()` in `utils.ts` properly escapes HTML entities
